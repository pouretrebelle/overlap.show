Charlotte is a designer/developer based in London, working across a wide spectrum of disciplines ranging from electronics to fine glasswork; she has not yet found a craft she does not wish to master.Â 

Since childhood Charlotte has struggled to find a balance between a fervent interest in mathematics and a proclivity for design and making. This manifested later in life as a BA in Jewellery Design and Silversmithing while moonlighting as a web developer, a practice she now employs professionally at a Music Technology company.

Charlotte has been exploring the intersection of these two disciplines, both in how computation can supplement traditional making techniques, as well as how the process of designing tangible objects can be informed by computational thinking. Her work is centred around nullifying the contradiction between being a maker and being a programmer.
