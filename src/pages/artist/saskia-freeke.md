Saskia Freeke is an artist, creative coder, interaction designer, visual designer and educator. Her art work focuses on structure, geometry and playfulness. A big part of her artistic practice is her ongoing daily art project that she started January 2015. Here she explores and experiments with generative patterns and animations daily.

Besides creating visually pleasing digital art works, she is interested in creating novel, tangible interfaces. Her research focuses on the cultural aspect of the interface, on the space between the human and the machine. She is interested in exploring what kind of effect certain interactions and interfaces have, both on the human and the machine. She wants to create interactive installations that engage the user in playful ways to let them explore the machine.

Alongside her artistic practise, Saskia works as a freelance interaction and visual designer. She was selected to be a Processing Foundation Fellow of 2017, and is the director of education for Code Liberation Foundation. Saskia has also previously taught in games and interaction design at the HKU University of the Arts Utrecht.
