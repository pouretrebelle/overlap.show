Friendred is an installation and visual artist currently based in London. In early 2012 he started creating abstract visual images, most of which followed themes of sexuality, exploring humanity and dematerialized existence. Inspired by pop culture and the Vaporwave aesthetic, Friendred has formed his own striking artistic style, traversing spectrums that are at once grotesque, counterintuitive and deeply affective. 
 
Friendred believes that art is sanctioned pornography. Since 2015, he has worked combining his visual sensibility with sound in installation settings. His work is now focused on a dialogue between spatiotemporal substances, sex and theology. He is trying to construct an outlandish dialogue between interoperated systems, surrealism and digitalised environments. He wants his audience to be baptised into his world when experiencing his art.
 
Friendredâ€™s aim is to break down the boundaries of pragmatic space and explore immersive forms of observation. He is keen to collaborate with pioneering artists who are working across other disciplines.
