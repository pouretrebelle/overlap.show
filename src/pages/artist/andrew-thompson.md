Andrew Thompson is a music technologist and creative coder from Surrey, currently exploring the role technology plays in music performance and creation. Using a combination of physical interfaces and programming, Andrew creates tangible performance instruments and playful musical interfaces for non-musicians.

His work is centred around the dichotomy of work and play, and how that manifests itself in instrument and interaction design; paying particular attention to the notion of sound toys and how the boundary of what that entails can be pushed. Past work includes ‘BitBox’, a hackable barebones synthesiser powered by a single ATmega328 chip and ‘Soundfuck’, a musical live coding environment based on the esoteric programming language Brainfuck.
