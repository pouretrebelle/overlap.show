Thalia Agroti is a Greek-Cypriot multidisciplinary artist currently based in London. While her work mainly revolves around experimental sound creation, she is currently interested in exploring more immersive sonic environments that can be manipulated in a more tactile and material sense.

Thalia is interested in understanding emotions, both in a cognitive and intuitive sense as well as challenging and evoking them through her work. She is also researching themes such as the human-machine relationship, control vs improvisation and chaos vs calm.

Thaliaâ€™s work has fluctuated between various mediums ranging from photography, film, web design, audio-visual installations and coding. With a passion for hardware, she is mostly involved in circuit bending toy instruments as well as building unconventional synths. Her sound work often contains a noisy flare and electronic beats with space-like tendencies usually deriving from freeform improvisations. More recently, she is shifting gears by working with ambient elements and carefully crafted productions.

Thalia has collaborated with Cypriot and London based sonic artists. She has released a tape compilation through the label Musica Dispersa and has exhibited audio-visual installations in both London and Cyprus.
