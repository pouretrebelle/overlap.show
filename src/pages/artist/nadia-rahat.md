*What You See - What I Am* represents a struggle to live and deal with a deformed identity.

Being a muslim dealing with a deformed identity is not only a challenge but also a frustration. The threat of being associated with terrorism can often become a rigid part of their identity. With growing Islamophobia all over the world, muslim individuals remain in constant tension between two extremes of what their identity is and what it is not.

*What You See - What I Am* is represented through two artworks. The first, *What You See*, is a projection that depicts a series of scenes that visually represent negative stereotyping. This stereotyping often ignores the fact that diversity does exist among muslim communities and can prompt people to unfairly see every individual with the same perception.

*What I am* is a physical, interactive piece which shows a more personal, subtle imagery. It requires the users involvement and encourages observers to be willing to develop a new perspective.
