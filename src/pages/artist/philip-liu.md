Philip Liu is a multidisciplinary artist from the United States/South Korea. Currently based in the UK, his work moves between the fields of music technology, electroacoustic composition and visual art. 
 
Philip works across various formats including, audiovisual, sonic art, installations, sheet music and improvisation. Two of the main concepts that form the core of his work are mathematical aesthetics and virtuality, and as a result of this, computation is heavily involved in most of his pieces. These core concepts often lead to explorations with various materials and technologies with the aim to blur out the border between the virtual world and the physical world. 
 
Philip has performed and exhibited his work across many countries; UK, Netherlands, United States, Japan and South Korea.
