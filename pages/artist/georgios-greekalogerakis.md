Georgios GreeKalogerakis was born in Thessaloniki Greece in 1978.  He studied construction techniques, with a specialisation in metal construction, and worked in the iron-building industry for a decade before embarking on a BA degree in Mixed Arts at the University of Westminster.

Georgios’ previous works include the undeniably impressive ‘S’ project (Stainless Steel Sound Sculptures), which was followed by the ‘LCLE-S’ project (Laser Cut and Laser Engraved Stainless Steel Sculptures), as well a number of digital prints on stainless steel. Motivated by two-dimensional life stories of glory and mythology represented in both Greek pottery and on the Parthenon’s pediments, he laser engraved and digitally printed onto stainless steels sheets. Through such processes, he create his own contemporary stories, examines issues relating to religion, art, gender, life and death, whilst always blending the imaginative into the real binary world.

Georgios had his first solo show in 2006. He has taken part in group shows and art fairs in London, Greece and the US. He lives in UK, working in his designing studio based in London and his workshop in Thessaloniki, Greece.
