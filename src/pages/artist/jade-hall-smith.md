*What Eye See* relays the idea of looking through someone else's eyes. Everybody sees things differently and so people are often misunderstood, often more so for people with disabilities, both visible and invisible. The piece hopes to create a sense of empathy and understanding through artistic expression, to show how other people may see things differently. For example, the different shapes, colours or forms that one user may choose in their art piece as opposed to another demonstrate specific decisions that can convey their own experience.

*What Eye See* is inspired by the ‘eyeWriter’ (2010)  which tracks the user’s eyes. The eyeWriter was created for a disabled graffiti artist, with no mobility, allowing him to create graffiti with his eyes instead of his hands. The technology was conceived by Mick Ebeling and created with the help of members from Free Art and Technology (FAT), OpenFrameworks and the Graffiti Research Lab. Further inspiration for this piece comes from 'Eyegaze technology' (1986) created by LC Technologies, inc. Eyegaze uses eye tracking technology which allow users with limited mobility to interact and communicate through technology.'

*What Eye See* uses an infrared camera that can pick up signals which can not be seen by the human eye. The camera is mounted on a pair of frames using aluminium wire. When the user moves their eyes, it can track the new position of the eye and sends this data to the computer. The software then allows the user to choose the colours and shapes to make an abstract artwork which is then projected onto a screen.

Jade Hall-Smith is a computational and digital artist based in London. She is interested in assistive and rehabilitative technology for people with disabilities. In particular, technology for people who have autism and how it can help them communicate.

Previously, Jade studied in graphic design and 3D modelling. She uses these skills heavily in her current work by creating 2D sketches and bringing them to life through 3D software and printing. She also enjoys working with physical computing, combining her knowledge of electronics and coding to create accessible hardware for people with disabilities.

Much of Jade’s previous work has involved creating technology for children on the autistic spectrum. One example would be ‘Twinkle-wear’, a shirt created to detect anxiety. The wearable technology incorporated into the shirts design monitors the user's pulse rate and can recognise an increase, which indicates a state of anxiety. When the user’s pulse rate rises above a specific level, lights on the shirt spin faster, indicating to a parent/carer that the user is feeling anxious.

Jade hopes to further explore how technology can aid individuals with autism and to create other projects around atypical and neurotypical people.
