This piece explores how human activities have changed the balance of the world. With Global Warming as a focus *What the Tree Sees* emphasises and challenges the anthropocene.

A virtual earth affected by global warming is surrounded by multiple sculptures. These sculptures made with both manmade and natural materials, represent individual buildings which combine to symbolise the form of tree trunk. This tree is a witness to current human activities which have jeopardised nature. By peering into the depths of these distorted buildings the viewer is able to see the effected earth that they sit on.

*What the Tree Sees* is a comment on how human activities have influenced nature and how those activities are the main reason for many of our global environmental issues.
