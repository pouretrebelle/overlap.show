Luis is a photographer, cartoonist and teacher based in London, who is currently exploring code to create engaging, interactive art and physical objects, exploring play and mimicry. He usually describes himself as a serial tinkerer and obsessive compulsive collector of cameras.
 
For the past eighteen years Luisâ€™ photographic work has demonstrated an interest in stories of a humanistic character, exploring the synchronicity and serendipity of day to day life. He has also enjoyed experimenting with using sound, illustration and video. Luis' interests in computational arts lie in exploring play as a journey of both discovery and self-discovery. Play has had an important role in humanity, in technological progress and Luis implements this philosophy at various levels in his work. 
 
Luis has had photographic works published as a press photographer, through various media channels and publications. Currently, Luis is focused on personal work of a more documentary/street character, taking an observers look at society and our human condition.
