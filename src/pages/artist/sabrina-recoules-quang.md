You look at me looking at you looking at us.

*Look At The Other* is a performance piece that explores otherness in a realm that mixes the real and the virtual. Using a mask that divides the artist’s face in half, the work forces its audience to see their own augmented self-image projected onto the mask. It recalls cyborgs as the ultimate expression of a mixed human reality, the ultimate Other, where our natural schizophrenia meets and blends with our very selves. Society gives us its mask to wear, thus giving us an “over- identity” that can fit in. Our true identity is like a crystal, made of extended faces not to be seen at the same time.

The use of computation in *Look At The Other* allows for the creation of new forms of theatrical staging, by facilitating encounters where virtuality meets reality. The use of techniques such as Computer Vision develop a co-dependent relationship between the audience, the artist and the computer, creating a dialogue that explores inter-mediation between ourselves and our extended bodies.

Taking inspiration in the staging from “The Artist is present” (*Marina Abramovic*, 2010). The performance is not completed until you, the Other sits in front of the artist. Out of time for three minutes, just the artist and you, the Other. As soon as she is looking at you, she will affect you. Contemplating the reflection of the artist in your eyes, she is looking at the mask of your social and public identity, and how she feels about it is an instant feedback of what she is. *Look at the Other* is a performing metaphor for this encounter.

Vietnamese, born in France, Sabrina is currently based in London. Alongside making and performing in puppetry and shadow theatre for five years, she has shaped her improvisation practice in London and Berlin with LISPA. She is now exploring the similarities and synergies between shadow theatre, embodiment and computational practice.

Introspections or interactions, Sabrina’s installations made of wood, paper, automata and found objects invite us to an emotional and playful response. In her imaginary worlds, animated projections and recorded voices share their memories when shadows, puppets and masks reveal the truth. Computation helps the process of amplification and distortion, making things move and speak.

Her creations have been performed and exhibited in London, Berlin, Paris and Malta. Her work mainly experimental, explores themes of motherhood, identity and memories. Always on the edge, between darkness and light, looking for rising again out of the frame. “Riding a pillow / in a car park / Bumping into / An old Cox style car / Feeling guilty /But actually amazed / That I could ride and /Be so light and free.” Berlin 2015).
