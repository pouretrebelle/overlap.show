Julianne Rahimi is a visual artist, photographer, and programmer with interests in fashion and visual storytelling.

She started her art career at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she pursued a Bachelor Degree in Art and Art History. During this time, her work was exhibited at five exhibitions on campus. Upon graduation, she attended Goldsmiths, University of London for her MFA in Computational Arts. She is interested in understanding where the real world and the digital world meet, and how that junction affects human life as a whole. Her practice focuses on user interactions and storytelling through various visual forms.

Recently, her practice has focused more on user interactions and she has begun exploring the ways in which technology has effected love. This exploration is about understanding the multiple selves, or how we are different online than we are in real life. Her project will include dialogs from online relationships to spark a conversation about the different personas we embody because of modern technology.
