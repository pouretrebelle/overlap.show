Freddie is an architecture and programming student based in London.

He completed a Bachelor in Architecture from the Bartlett School of Architecture with his final project involving transforming human memory into architectural geometry. Freddie’s recent thesis on ‘Computational Design in Architecture’ shows his interests in ‘the other ways of designing’ where he explores the methods of involving human bodies and other qualitative matters of the environment in design of the space.

Freddie’s work has been featured in Fastco Design and he won the UCL Making Building Prize (2016). In 2015 he worked for Korean/Japanese practice, ‘Itami Jun’ as an Architecture Assistant and will be joining Italian practice, ‘Carlo Ratti Associati’ in July. He has collaborated with many artists, helping to construct the kinetic aspects of their sculptures and has had his own work featured in a number of international articles.
