*Hexatope* is a design system based on a hexagonal grid. With a simple interface and intuitive set of rules it enables users to design beautiful, complex and unique forms without prior experience. Using touch or mouse input, users draw undulating curves which diverge and overlap one another with seemingly organic grace.

*Hexatope* is a facilitator of co-creation; it encourages users to discover how it works by interacting with it. In parallel to their exploration of it as a tool, they develop their own artistic style within the aesthetic framework of the grid and its ruleset.

Algorithms determine how the curves interact in 3D space, creating objects where tactility and tangibility are paramount. In this exhibition the *Hexatope* system manifests as pieces of jewellery; the preciosity of the pieces highlights both the elegance of the system and the importance of the designer’s intentions.

With the aid of interactive technology *Hexatope* aims to spark creativity in its users, they have the potential not only to be designers, but to be creators of beautiful and personal physical objects regardless of their aptitude for design.

The *Hexatope* system is built using JavaScript and web technologies, with WebGL to render a preview of the model. The pieces are exported as 3D objects and printed with castable liquid resin, then using the lost-wax method the 3D-printed pieces are cast into sterling silver and finished and polished by hand.

Charlotte is a designer/developer based in London, working across a wide spectrum of disciplines ranging from electronics to fine glasswork; she has not yet found a craft she does not wish to master. 

Since childhood Charlotte has struggled to find a balance between a fervent interest in mathematics and a proclivity for design and making. This manifested later in life as a BA in Jewellery Design and Silversmithing while moonlighting as a web developer, a practice she now employs professionally at a Music Technology company.

Charlotte has been exploring the intersection of these two disciplines, both in how computation can supplement traditional making techniques, as well as how the process of designing tangible objects can be informed by computational thinking. Her work is centred around nullifying the contradiction between being a maker and being a programmer.
