Ewa Justka is a polish electronic noise artist, self-taught instruments builder and electronics teacher based in London. 

Ewa’s main field of research is based on exploration of materiality of objects, vibrant, ontological systems (human bodies, plant bodies, electronic circuits: varied range of micro and macro environments and relations between them) and an investigation of modes of quasi-direct perception through noise performance actions, interactive installation, DIY electronics, hardware hacking, plant-molesting, breaking, deconstructing and collaborating. In her artistic work Ewa attempts to explore the concept of materiality of the hidden.

Ewa has performed and led workshops at festivals and venues in Europe and in UK like:  Loop Festival (DE), Sonic Acts (NL), Supernormal Festival (UK), Club Transmediale (DE), STEIM (NL), Incubate Festival (NL), Colour out of Space (UK), Beam Festival (UK), Cafe Oto (UK), Goldsmiths University (UK), Unsound Festival (PL), Norberg Festival (SE) and more.
