Howard Melnyczuk is an artist investigating contemporary culture through critical theory, art practice and research. His practice explores technology as a site in which contemporary political structures are both built and maintained. His work reveal alternative forms of understanding, problematise cultural norms surrounding technology, and unpack the false assumptions that re-enforce hidden operations of power and control. 

Howard's work combines video, photography, design, sound, writing and publishing with computational technologies and code. By combining different media formats, he brings out the commonalities in form and structure that provide an understanding of how cultural materials operate. 

Howard is now interested in how the creation, archiving and implementations of data structures are creating alternative realities. Previous works explore the digitisation of celluloid film, and the vast unknowable continent of Antarctica via satellite imagery.
