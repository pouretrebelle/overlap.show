*SCROLLLLLL* is a playful and tangible interactive installation that reflects on our daily interactions with technology. We engage with technology everyday, scrolling up and down through images and text on social media channels, using the same gestures over and over. These gestures are embedded in our daily lives and have become almost unconscious, and we rarely think about what they are or what they mean. *SCROLLLLLL* makes these interactions playful. The artworks draw on research that shows that when we play as an approach to experience the world, we are more open to exploring. We explore through engaging with technology. When we explore, we play.

*SCROLLLLLL* consists of two pieces, the first translates physical interactions onto the digital screen. Pulling a strap causes the scrolling of an adjacent digital screen overloaded with gifs that themselves take a playful approach to our current use of technology.

The second piece translates digital interaction to a physical screen. A familiar scrolling gesture on a touchscreen enables a physical scrolling, or flipping, through multiple analog mechanical flip screens comprised of coloured cards with lasercut tweets about technology.

The design of the installation is open and transparent. It shows how each machine works. Taking inspiration from playground equipment, the works deliberately avoid hiding the way each artefact functions. Showing the mechanism or technology contributes to the pleasure of the interaction, to the beauty of the machine and our playful attitude towards the technology we are engaging with.

The installation invites you to explore and engage with physical and digital interactions, in the hope of opening your views towards technology. Letâ€™s explore and play more in our daily lives.

Saskia Freeke is an artist, creative coder, interaction designer, visual designer and educator. Her art work focuses on structure, geometry and playfulness. A big part of her artistic practice is her ongoing daily art project that she started January 2015. Here she explores and experiments with generative patterns and animations daily.

Besides creating visually pleasing digital art works, she is interested in creating novel, tangible interfaces. Her research focuses on the cultural aspect of the interface, on the space between the human and the machine. She is interested in exploring what kind of effect certain interactions and interfaces have, both on the human and the machine. She wants to create interactive installations that engage the user in playful ways to let them explore the machine.

Alongside her artistic practise, Saskia works as a freelance interaction and visual designer. She was selected to be a Processing Foundation Fellow of 2017, and is the director of education for Code Liberation Foundation. Saskia has also previously taught in games and interaction design at the HKU University of the Arts Utrecht.
