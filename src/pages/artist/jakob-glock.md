Jakob Glock is a creative coder from Cornwall, currently based in London. Driven by a sense of curiosity, he explores the use of code to build generative systems inspired by nature, science, sound and graphics programming.
 
His previous works include interactive soundtoys which allow the user to play with both sound and visuals, generative visual sequences which explore visual forms and the structures that can arise from them and studies into the creation of physical artefacts through the use of digital computation.
