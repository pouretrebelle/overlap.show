*Pixel Blast* is an interactive installation made up of nine 'Persistence of Vision' displays which come together to create hologram-like images. Persistence of vision works because the human eye and brain can only process 10 to 12 separate images per second. This phenomenon make this spinning LED project possible. This project challenges the idea of what a screen has to be, presenting something far more rich than a computer display. By spinning a single long strip of lights around its centre the illusion of pixels appear along the arc of rotation. This is both mesmerising and exciting, as a new form appears - that of a digital canvas.

The artist tracks the audience's movement using a Microsoft Kinect. This human awareness contextualises the visual image, linking it back to the viewer. The unison of all nine units working together brings a harmony to this larger system, enveloping each individual unit and it own unique characteristics. This project seeks to explore forms beyond the traditional screen through this collective output. By then feeding back the real world, the artist gives us a glimpse of a bold visual reflection and of a possible future.

Natthakit Kangsadansenanon is an architect / artist from Thailand.  He is interested in incorporating the intelligence of the digital technologies into the existing objects of daily life. He begins his practice by looking around and finding an interesting object that has always been there, then he asks how could it be improved without destroying the existing relationship between it and its users. His goal is to make objects that are at once simple, artistic and imbued with a greater awareness of humanity.

Natthakit's work may, for example, integrate a sensor and an actuator into an existing product that we use in everyday life - such as chair. Traditionally, a chair can’t understand the moods or needs of its user when they come to sit: it is just a chair. But Natthakit is interested in how much the chair could come to know about its users, and how it could react accordingly, while retaining the simple relationship that people have when they take a seat. As technology becomes increasingly complex, and increasingly complex technology becomes ever more present in our daily lives, it is the challenge of maintaining this simplicity that is at the heart of all Natthakit's designs.
